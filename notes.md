# Setup server using Vagrant and Chef

I used GoFullStack/cocoon as a framework to set this up, [see cocoon](https://github.com/gofullstack/cocoon), and [article](http://gofullstack.com/articles/using-vagrant-and-chef-for-reproducible-rails-development-environments.html).  

Install the vagrant Omnibus plugin - so that chef can be provisioned into the VM
``` $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus```
